# BoxBox

Ultra lightweight docker containers on demand w/ Riven Middleware & Wetty

### Todo

Graceful Error Handling. I want to be able to clear all of the boxbox docker containers on event of a crash.

Idle destroy containers. Possibly use websockets to do this?

Auto-Login option to docker containers

More default containers

Frontend menu

Bug: Wait may call new_node multiple tines. Don't do this.

Look into Guacamole or something else for VNC or RDP
